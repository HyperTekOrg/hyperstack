  order: 2
---

Explore and analyze Solana IDL (Interface Definition Language) files directly from the command line.

The `hs idl` suite helps you understand a program's structure, account layouts, and relationships before you start building your stack.

---

## Global Behavior

These rules apply to all `hs idl` subcommands:

- **Path argument**: Every subcommand takes `<path>` as its first positional argument (the path to the IDL JSON file).
- **JSON output**: Most commands support the `--json` flag for machine-readable output.
- **Fuzzy matching**: Lookups for instructions, accounts, and types are case-insensitive. If you make a typo, the CLI suggests the closest match.
- **Error handling**: File-not-found or invalid names exit with code 1 and a clear message.
