`hyperstack-server` is a Rust crate that lets you run your compiled stack as a standalone WebSocket server. It connects to a Yellowstone gRPC endpoint, processes Solana data through your projections, and streams the results to connected clients.

## Prerequisites

To run a stack with `hyperstack-server`, you need:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Yellowstone gRPC Endpoint** | A URL to a Solana node running the [Yellowstone Geyser plugin](https://github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-grpc). This is your source of blockchain data. |
| **X-Token** | Authentication token for your Yellowstone provider (most providers require this). |
| **Rust 1.75+** | Required to build the server binary. |
| **A compiled stack** | Your stack crate with the `#[hyperstack(...)]` macro, which generates a `spec()` function. |

:::caution[Yellowstone Access Required]
You must have access to a Yellowstone gRPC endpoint. Options include:
- Running your own Solana validator with the Yellowstone Geyser plugin
- Using a provider like Triton, Helius, or similar that offers Yellowstone gRPC
:::

## Environment Variables

`hyperstack-server` reads configuration from environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `YELLOWSTONE_ENDPOINT` | Yes | Your Yellowstone gRPC endpoint URL |
| `YELLOWSTONE_X_TOKEN` | Usually | Authentication token for the endpoint |

## When to Use hyperstack-server

**Use hyperstack-server when:**
- Developing and testing stacks locally
- Running a single stack in your own infrastructure
- You need full control over the server deployment
- You already have Yellowstone gRPC access

**Consider Hyperstack Cloud when:**
- You need multi-stack orchestration
- You want managed Yellowstone infrastructure
- You need built-in authentication and API keys
- You prefer zero-config deployment
