If you haven't set up an AI coding tool yet, start with [AI Tooling Setup](/agent-skills/setup-tools/) which walks you through everything from scratch.

Hyperstack is designed to be built with AI agents. This page explains the three pieces that make that work: the **CLI**, the **agent skills**, and **agent.md**.

---

## The CLI

The Hyperstack CLI (`hs`) is the primary interface between your agent and Hyperstack. It handles scaffolding, deployment, SDK generation, and — most importantly — live schema discovery.

```bash
# Install via Cargo (recommended)
cargo install hyperstack-cli

# Or via npm
npm install -g hyperstack-cli
```

The key command for agents is `hs explore`:

```bash
hs explore --json
```

This queries the Hyperstack API and returns the live schemas for all available stacks — their entities, fields, views, and types. Because your agent runs this at setup time, it always works with accurate, up-to-date type information rather than guessing from training data.

## Agent Skills

Agent skills are markdown files that teach your agent how to use Hyperstack correctly. They're installed into your project so your agent picks them up automatically as context.

Three skills are installed:

| Skill                | What it teaches                                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hyperstack`         | Router skill — detects intent and routes the agent to the right sub-skill |
| `hyperstack-consume` | SDK patterns for connecting to streams in TypeScript, React, and Rust     |
| `hyperstack-build`   | Rust DSL syntax for building custom stacks from Solana program IDLs       |

Install them manually with:

```bash
npx skills add usehyperstack/skills
```

Once installed, your agent knows the correct hook names, view patterns, subscription syntax, and CLI commands. Without the skills, an agent will hallucinate API shapes based on outdated training data.

## agent.md

`agent.md` is a plain text file hosted at `https://docs.usehyperstack.com/agent.md`. It's the bootstrap instruction set — a single URL your agent can read to set everything up from scratch.

When your agent reads `agent.md`, it:

1. Installs the Hyperstack CLI (prefers Cargo, falls back to npm)
2. Installs the agent skills into the project
3. Runs `hs explore --json` to load live schemas
4. Understands it's ready to build

This is why the one-liner works:

<CopyPrompt>
Read https://docs.usehyperstack.com/agent.md and follow the instructions to set up Hyperstack in this project
</CopyPrompt>

## How They Fit Together

```
agent.md  ──▶  CLI installed  ──▶  hs explore --json  ──▶  live schemas
               Skills installed ─▶  SDK patterns + DSL syntax

                         ┌────────────────────────────┐
                         │         AI Agent            │
                         │  (Cursor, Claude Code, etc) │
                         │                             │
                         │  Skills  +  Live schemas    │
                         └────────────┬───────────────┘
                                      │
                              builds correct code
                                      │
                                      ▼
                               Your Hyperstack app
```

The CLI gives the agent **live data**. The skills give the agent **correct patterns**. Together they remove the two main failure modes: wrong types and wrong API usage.

## Prefer to Set Up Manually?

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="New Project">

```bash
cargo install hyperstack-cli
# Or: npm install -g hyperstack-cli

npx hyperstack-cli create my-app --template react-ore
cd my-app

npx skills add usehyperstack/skills
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Existing Project">

```bash
cargo install hyperstack-cli
# Or: npm install -g hyperstack-cli

npx skills add usehyperstack/skills
```

</TabItem>
