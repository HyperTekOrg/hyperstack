Reference for installing Hyperstack agent skills manually. For an overview of how skills, the CLI, and agent.md fit together, see [Agent Skills](/agent-skills/overview/).

The universal install command (auto-detects your editor):

```bash
npx skills add usehyperstack/skills
```

`npx skills` supports 35+ agents:

| Agent      | Flag                 |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| Codex      | `--agent codex`      |
| Gemini CLI | `--agent gemini-cli` |
| Roo Code   | `--agent roo`        |
| Goose      | `--agent goose`      |
| Continue   | `--agent continue`   |

If your editor isn't listed, manually copy the SKILL.md files from the [skills repository](https://github.com/usehyperstack/skills) into whatever directory your editor reads custom context from.

</Tabs>

## Verifying Installation

Ask your agent:

<CopyPrompt>
What stacks are available on Hyperstack? Show me the entities and fields for the ore stack.
</CopyPrompt>

The agent should run `hs explore --json`, then `hs explore ore --json`, and present the entity names, field paths, and types. If it doesn't recognise Hyperstack commands, check that the skill files are in the correct directory for your editor.

---

## Updating Skills

```bash
npx skills add usehyperstack/skills
```

This overwrites existing skill files with the latest versions. The static patterns (SDK syntax, DSL macros) change rarely — dynamic data (entity schemas, field types) always comes from `hs explore` at runtime, so it's always current regardless of skill version.
