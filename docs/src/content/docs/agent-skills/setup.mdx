description: Manual setup for Hyperstack agent skills in Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code, Windsurf, and other AI coding tools.
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import CopyPrompt from "../../../components/CopyPrompt.astro";

:::tip[Let your agent handle this]
The easiest setup is to paste this into your agent and let it do everything:

<CopyPrompt>
Read https://docs.usehyperstack.com/agent.md and follow the instructions to set up Hyperstack in this project
</CopyPrompt>

See [Build with AI](/agent-skills/overview/) for details. The instructions below are for manual setup.
:::

If you prefer to install skills yourself, the universal command is:

```bash
npx skills add usehyperstack/skills
```

This auto-detects your editor and installs the skill files to the right location. For editor-specific details or manual placement, see below.

## Supported Editors

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Cursor">

```bash
npx skills add usehyperstack/skills --agent cursor
```

Skill files are created in `.agents/skills/` in your project directory:

```
.agents/skills/
├── hyperstack/SKILL.md
├── hyperstack-consume/SKILL.md
└── hyperstack-build/SKILL.md
```

To install manually, download the SKILL.md files from the [skills repo](https://github.com/usehyperstack/skills) and place them in `.agents/skills/`.

:::tip[Allow CLI access]
When Cursor asks to run `hs explore`, approve it. The CLI commands are safe to run.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Claude Code">

```bash
npx skills add usehyperstack/skills --agent claude-code
```

Skills are installed in the `.claude/skills/` directory:

```
.claude/skills/
├── hyperstack/SKILL.md
├── hyperstack-consume/SKILL.md
└── hyperstack-build/SKILL.md
```

You can also set project-level context in `CLAUDE.md` at the project root.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Windsurf">

```bash
npx skills add usehyperstack/skills --agent windsurf
```

Skills are installed in `.windsurf/skills/`:

```
.windsurf/skills/
├── hyperstack/SKILL.md
├── hyperstack-consume/SKILL.md
└── hyperstack-build/SKILL.md
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="GitHub Copilot">

```bash
npx skills add usehyperstack/skills --agent github-copilot
```

Skills are installed in `.agents/skills/`:

```
.agents/skills/
├── hyperstack/SKILL.md
├── hyperstack-consume/SKILL.md
└── hyperstack-build/SKILL.md
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="OpenCode">

```bash
npx skills add usehyperstack/skills --agent opencode
```

Skills are installed in `.agents/skills/`:

```
.agents/skills/
├── hyperstack/SKILL.md
├── hyperstack-consume/SKILL.md
└── hyperstack-build/SKILL.md
```

You can also load skills directly in OpenCode using the `/skill` command.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Cline">

```bash
npx skills add usehyperstack/skills --agent cline
```

Skills are installed in `.cline/skills/`:

```
.cline/skills/
├── hyperstack/SKILL.md
├── hyperstack-consume/SKILL.md
└── hyperstack-build/SKILL.md
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Other">

The `npx skills` CLI supports 35+ agents. Common options:

| Agent      | Flag                 |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| Codex      | `--agent codex`      |
| Gemini CLI | `--agent gemini-cli` |
| Roo Code   | `--agent roo`        |
| Goose      | `--agent goose`      |
| Continue   | `--agent continue`   |

Run without `--agent` to auto-detect your environment:

```bash
npx skills add usehyperstack/skills
```

If your editor isn't supported, manually copy the SKILL.md files from the [skills repository](https://github.com/usehyperstack/skills) into whatever location your editor reads custom context from.

## Prerequisites

Agent skills reference the Hyperstack CLI for live schema discovery. Make sure the CLI is installed:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Cargo">

```bash
cargo install hyperstack-cli
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="npm">

```bash
npm install -g hyperstack-cli
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The skills tell your agent to run `hs explore --json` to discover stacks and schemas. Without the CLI installed, the agent can still use the static SDK patterns from the skills, but won't be able to discover live schema information.

---

## Verifying Installation

After installing, ask your agent a Hyperstack question. For example:

<CopyPrompt>
What stacks are available on Hyperstack? Show me the entities and fields for the ore stack.
</CopyPrompt>

The agent should:

1. Run `hs explore --json` to list available stacks
2. Run `hs explore ore --json` to get the ore stack schema
3. Present the entity names, field paths, and types

If the agent doesn't recognize Hyperstack commands, check that the skill files are in the correct directory for your editor.

---

## Updating Skills

Skills are version-independent. The static patterns (SDK syntax, DSL macros) change rarely, and the dynamic data (entity schemas, field types) comes from `hs explore` which always reflects your installed CLI version.

To update skills to the latest version:

```bash
npx skills add usehyperstack/skills
```

This overwrites the existing skill files with the latest versions.
