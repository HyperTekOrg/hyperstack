Curated prompts to help your AI agent build with Hyperstack. These are designed to be copied directly into your agent chat (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) to automate discovery and implementation.

## Consuming ORE (React)

### Live ORE Mining Dashboard
> I want to build a React + Vite app that shows live ORE mining data from Hyperstack. First run `hs explore ore --json` to get the schema. Install `hyperstack-react` and `hyperstack-stacks`. Create a dashboard that shows:
> - The current round number and motherlode amount
> - Total miners and total SOL deployed
> - A countdown to round expiration (expires_at is a slot number, estimated_expires_at_unix is a unix timestamp)
> - Connection status indicator
> Use the `OreRound.latest` view with `useOne()` for the current round, and `OreTreasury.list` with `useOne()` for treasury data. Use tailwind for styling.

**What you should get:** A React app with `HyperstackProvider`, `useHyperstack` hook, live-updating round stats, and a connection badge.

### ORE Round History Table
> Build a React component that shows a table of ORE mining rounds. Run `hs explore ore OreRound --json` to get the fields. Use `hyperstack-react` and `hyperstack-stacks`. Subscribe to `OreRound.list` view using `.use()` to get all rounds. Display columns: Round #, Motherlode, Total Miners, Deploy Count, Top Miner (truncated address), and whether the motherlode was hit. Sort by round_id descending. Add a search/filter for minimum motherlode amount.

**What you should get:** A paginated or scrollable table showing historical ORE rounds with real-time updates as new rounds complete.

### ORE Miner Lookup
> Create a React component where users can paste a Solana wallet address and see that miner's ORE stats. Run `hs explore ore OreMiner --json` to get the fields. Use the `OreMiner.state` view to look up a specific miner by their authority address. Show: lifetime deployed, lifetime ORE rewards, lifetime SOL rewards, refined ORE, unclaimed rewards, and automation settings (strategy, balance). Use hyperstack-react and hyperstack-stacks.

**What you should get:** A search interface that pulls specific miner profile data directly from the Hyperstack stream.

## Consuming ORE (TypeScript CLI)

### ORE Round Monitor CLI
> Build a TypeScript CLI tool that monitors ORE mining rounds in real-time. Use `hyperstack-typescript` and `hyperstack-stacks`. Connect to ORE_STREAM_STACK using HyperStack.connect(). Watch the `OreRound.latest` view with `take: 1`. On each update, print: Round number, motherlode amount, total miners, total deployed, deploy count, and time until expiration. Use Zod schema validation with OreRoundSchema. Exit cleanly on SIGINT.

**What you should get:** A terminal utility that prints a clean, live-updating summary of every ORE round.

### ORE Treasury Tracker
> Create a TypeScript script that tracks the ORE treasury state. Use hyperstack-typescript and hyperstack-stacks. Connect and watch `OreTreasury.list` with `take: 1`. Log treasury balance, motherlode, total staked, total refined, and total unclaimed. Calculate and display the percentage of ORE that is staked vs unclaimed.

**What you should get:** A script for monitoring treasury health and distribution metrics.

## Building Custom Stacks

### Build a custom stack for [Protocol X]
> I want to build a Hyperstack stack that tracks [describe the protocol and what data you want]. 
> 
> First, I need the Anchor IDL for this program. The program ID is [PROGRAM_ID]. Try these approaches to get the IDL:
> 1. Check if the program's GitHub repo has an IDL in `target/idl/` or `idl/` directory
> 2. Try `anchor idl fetch [PROGRAM_ID] --provider.cluster mainnet` (requires Anchor CLI)
> 3. Search for the IDL on GitHub: look for the program name + "idl.json"
> 4. Check if there's an npm package with the IDL (e.g., `@[protocol]/sdk`)
>
> Once you have the IDL JSON file, save it to `idl/program_name.json`. Then create a Hyperstack stack following the building-stacks docs. Use `#[hyperstack(idl = "idl/program_name.json")]` to reference it. Define entities for the main account types I want to track, with sections for identity fields, state fields, and any computed metrics.

**What you should get:** The agent finds or guides you to the IDL, then scaffolds a new Hyperstack project with entities, field mappings, and views.

### Add a new entity to my stack
> I have an existing Hyperstack stack and I want to add a new entity that tracks [describe account type]. Run `hs explore --json` to see my current stack. The IDL is already at `idl/[program].json`. Look at the IDL accounts to find the [AccountName] struct, then create a new entity with appropriate sections and field mappings. Follow the same patterns as the existing entities in my stack.

**What you should get:** A new entity definition added to your `stack.rs` with correct type mappings from the IDL.

## Exploring and Discovery

### What data is available?
> Run `hs explore --json` and tell me what Hyperstack stacks are available. For each stack, run `hs explore [stack-name] --json` to list the entities. Then for the most interesting entities, run `hs explore [stack-name] [Entity] --json` to show me the fields and types. Summarize what data I can stream from each stack.

**What you should get:** A comprehensive overview of all data you can currently access through your Hyperstack installation.
