import CopyPrompt from "../../../components/CopyPrompt.astro";

You don't need to know how to code to build with Hyperstack. AI coding tools can write all the code for you — you just tell them what you want in plain English.

Hyperstack works with any AI coding agent. This guide uses **Cursor** as the example, but the same steps apply to Claude Code, Windsurf, OpenCode, or any other agent you prefer.

---

## What You'll Need

- A computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- An internet connection
- About 10 minutes

That's it. No programming experience required.

---

## Step 1: Install Cursor

[Cursor](https://cursor.sh) is an AI-powered code editor — a good starting point if you don't already have a tool you prefer.

1. Go to [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh) and download the version for your OS
2. Open the downloaded file and follow the installation prompts
3. Launch Cursor and create a free account

:::tip[Already have an AI coding tool?]
If you're already using Claude Code, Windsurf, OpenCode, or another agent, skip to [Step 2](#step-2-create-a-project-folder). Hyperstack works with all of them.

:::tip[Cursor is free to start]
Cursor offers a free tier with limited AI queries per month — plenty for getting started.

## Step 2: Create a Project Folder

Create a folder for your project and open it in your AI tool.

**On Mac:** Open Finder, navigate to Documents (or wherever you keep projects), right-click → **New Folder**, name it `my-hyperstack-app`, then open it in Cursor via **File → Open Folder**.

**On Windows:** Open File Explorer, navigate to Documents, right-click → **New → Folder**, name it `my-hyperstack-app`, then open it in Cursor via **File → Open Folder**.

**On Linux / terminal-based tools:**
```bash
mkdir ~/my-hyperstack-app
cd ~/my-hyperstack-app
```
Then open the folder in your editor, or start your agent in that directory.

---

## Step 3: Let Your AI Set Up Hyperstack

Paste this prompt into your AI assistant's chat:

<CopyPrompt>
Read https://docs.usehyperstack.com/agent.md and follow the instructions to set up Hyperstack in this project
</CopyPrompt>

In Cursor, press `Cmd+L` (Mac) or `Ctrl+L` (Windows) to open the AI chat sidebar, paste the prompt, and press Enter. Approve any commands it asks to run.

For terminal-based agents (Claude Code, OpenCode, etc.), just paste it directly and press Enter.

### What happens next

Your AI will:

1. **Install the Hyperstack CLI** — the command-line tool for Hyperstack
2. **Install agent skills** — teaching itself how to use Hyperstack correctly
3. **Discover available data** — finding out what blockchain data you can access
4. **Be ready to build** — waiting for your next instruction

This takes about 1–2 minutes.

---

## Step 4: Scaffold the ORE Template

Run this in your terminal to create a working ORE dashboard:

```bash
npx hyperstack-cli create my-ore-app --template react-ore
cd my-ore-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and you'll see live ORE mining data streaming from Solana.

---

## Step 5: Customise It With Your AI

Now open the project in Cursor and try this prompt:

<CopyPrompt>
I have a Hyperstack ORE dashboard running using the react-ore template. Update the mining grid so each square is coloured as a heatmap based on the amount of SOL deployed to that square — more SOL should glow brighter. Keep the existing dark theme.
</CopyPrompt>

Your AI already knows how to use Hyperstack from Step 3 — it will find the right views and update the component for you.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Command not found" errors** — You may need to install Node.js first. Download the LTS version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), install it, then restart your AI tool and try again.

**The AI seems confused** — Make sure it completed Step 3. You can re-paste the setup prompt to re-run it.
