## What is Hyperstack?

Hyperstack is **data infrastructure as code** for Solana. Define a schema that connects your onchain accounts and we create the backend infrastructure for you.

**We handle:**
- Streaming onchain data from RPC nodes
- Indexing the schema you defined
- WebSocket streaming of that schema into your app
- Generating type-safe client code to sync the schema into your app

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Real-time Sync" icon="rocket">
    React hooks that give you your application state as soon as it happens on chain, already formatted in your desired schema.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Infrastructure as Code" icon="setting">
    No complex Solana infrastructure to manage. Focus on building your app, not maintaining servers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Type-safe SDKs" icon="document">
    Auto-generated type-safe client code based on your schema definition. TypeScript, Python, and Rust.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Schema-Driven" icon="puzzle">
    Define your data schema once and we handle streaming, indexing, and syncing automatically.

## Quick Example

```typescript
// Define your stack
const TokenStack = defineStack({
  name: 'my-tokens',
  views: {
    tokens: {
      list: createListView<Token>('Token/list'),
      state: createStateView<Token>('Token/state'),
    },
  },
});

// Use in your React app
function TokenList() {
  const stack = useHyperstack(TokenStack);
  const { data: tokens } = stack.views.tokens.list.use();

  return tokens?.map(token => <TokenCard key={token.mint} {...token} />);
}
```
