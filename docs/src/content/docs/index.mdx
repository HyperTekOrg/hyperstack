**Programmable data streams for Solana.** No indexers. No polling. No infrastructure to manage.

Hyperstack streams real-time blockchain data directly to your app. Define what data you need and Hyperstack transforms on-chain events into typed, live feeds — consumed via React hooks, TypeScript streams, or Rust clients.

## What is Hyperstack?

Hyperstack connects your app to live Solana blockchain data. Instead of polling RPCs or building custom indexers, you define what data you want and Hyperstack streams it to you as it happens on-chain.

<Workflow steps={[
  {
    title: "Solana",
    description: "On-chain data"
  },
  {
    title: "Hyperstack",
    description: "Transforms + streams"
  },
  {
    title: "Your App",
    description: "Live feed"
  }
]} />

**Think of it like a live database query against the blockchain** — you subscribe once and get updates pushed to you automatically.

## See It In Action

Connect to the public ORE mining stack — a live feed of blockchain mining activity. No account required.

<TabItem label="React">
```tsx
import { HyperstackProvider, useHyperstack } from 'hyperstack-react';
import { ORE_STREAM_STACK } from 'hyperstack-stacks/ore';

function App() {

      <LatestRounds />
    </HyperstackProvider>

}

function LatestRounds() {
  const { views, isConnected } = useHyperstack(ORE_STREAM_STACK);
  const { data: rounds, isLoading } = views.OreRound.latest.use({ take: 5 });

  if (isLoading) return <div>Connecting...</div>;

    let mut stream = hs.views.ore_round.latest().listen().take(1);

## How It Works

Hyperstack handles the full pipeline from chain to client:

<Workflow steps={[
  {
    title: "Solana",
    description: "On-chain data"
  },
  {
    title: "Hyperstack",
    description: "Transform + stream"
  },
  {
    title: "Your App",
    description: "Live feed"
  }
]} />

1. **Define** the data shape you need using a declarative Rust DSL
2. **Deploy** your definition — Hyperstack manages the infrastructure
3. **Stream** live updates to any client via WebSocket

## Build with AI

Paste this into any AI coding assistant (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, or any agent that can read URLs) and it will set up Hyperstack and build an ORE mining dashboard for you:

<CopyPrompt>
Read https://docs.usehyperstack.com/agent.md and follow the instructions to set up Hyperstack in this project. Then build a React dashboard that shows live ORE mining round data with Tailwind CSS dark theme.
</CopyPrompt>

Your AI will install the CLI, learn the SDK patterns, connect to live Solana data, and build the app — all from that one prompt.
