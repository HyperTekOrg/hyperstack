import { Tabs, TabItem, Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import CopyPrompt from "../../../components/CopyPrompt.astro";

You don't need to know how to code to build with Hyperstack. AI coding tools can write all the code for you — you just tell them what you want in plain English.

This guide walks you through setting up an AI coding assistant from scratch.

---

## What You'll Need

- A computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- An internet connection
- About 10 minutes

That's it. No programming experience required.

---

## Step 1: Choose and Install an AI Coding Tool

An AI coding tool is like having a programmer assistant. You describe what you want, and it writes the code. Here are the most popular options:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Cursor (Recommended)">

**Cursor** is the easiest option for beginners. It's a code editor with AI built-in.

### Install Cursor

1. Go to [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh)
2. Click the download button for your computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
3. Open the downloaded file and follow the installation prompts
4. Launch Cursor and create a free account

### First-time setup

When Cursor opens for the first time:

1. It will ask if you want to import settings from VS Code — click "Skip" if you're new
2. Sign up with your email or Google account
3. You're ready to go!

:::tip[Cursor is free to start]
Cursor offers a free tier with limited AI queries per month. That's plenty for getting started.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Claude Code">

**Claude Code** is an AI assistant that runs in your terminal (the command line). It's powerful but requires a bit more setup.

### Prerequisites

You'll need:

- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac, Command Prompt on Windows)
- Node.js installed ([download here](https://nodejs.org))

### Install Claude Code

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Then start it with:

```bash
claude
```

### First-time setup

1. You'll be prompted to sign in to your Anthropic account
2. If you don't have one, create an account at [anthropic.com](https://anthropic.com)
3. Follow the authentication prompts

:::note[Claude Code requires an API key]
Claude Code uses the Anthropic API, which requires a paid plan after the free trial. See [Anthropic's pricing](https://anthropic.com/pricing) for details.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Windsurf">

**Windsurf** is another AI-powered code editor, similar to Cursor.

### Install Windsurf

1. Go to [codeium.com/windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)
2. Download for your operating system
3. Install and launch
4. Create a free Codeium account

### First-time setup

Windsurf will guide you through initial setup. Just follow the on-screen prompts.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="VS Code + Copilot">

If you already have **Visual Studio Code**, you can add GitHub Copilot:

### Install GitHub Copilot

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (click the blocks icon on the left sidebar)
3. Search for "GitHub Copilot"
4. Click Install
5. Sign in with your GitHub account

:::note[Copilot requires a subscription]
GitHub Copilot is $10/month for individuals, or free for students and open source maintainers.
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Create Your First Project

Now let's create a folder for your project and open it in your AI tool.

### Create a project folder

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Mac">

1. Open **Finder**
2. Go to your Documents folder (or wherever you want to store projects)
3. Right-click and choose **New Folder**
4. Name it `my-hyperstack-app`

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Windows">

1. Open **File Explorer**
2. Go to your Documents folder (or wherever you want to store projects)
3. Right-click and choose **New → Folder**
4. Name it `my-hyperstack-app`

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Linux">

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
mkdir ~/my-hyperstack-app
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Open the folder in your AI tool

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Cursor / Windsurf / VS Code">

1. Open Cursor (or Windsurf, or VS Code)
2. Click **File → Open Folder**
3. Navigate to `my-hyperstack-app` and select it
4. Click **Open**

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Claude Code">

Open your terminal and navigate to the folder:

```bash
cd ~/my-hyperstack-app
claude
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

## Step 3: Let AI Set Up Hyperstack

Now for the magic part. Just paste this prompt into your AI assistant:

<CopyPrompt>
Read https://docs.usehyperstack.com/agent.md and follow the instructions to set up Hyperstack in this project
</CopyPrompt>

### How to use the prompt

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Cursor">

1. Press `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows) to open the AI chat
2. Paste the prompt above
3. Press Enter
4. Say "Yes" when it asks to run commands

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Claude Code">

1. Just paste the prompt directly into the terminal where Claude is running
2. Press Enter
3. Approve any file changes or commands it suggests

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Windsurf">

1. Click the AI chat panel (usually on the right side)
2. Paste the prompt above
3. Press Enter
4. Approve any suggested actions

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="VS Code + Copilot">

1. Press `Cmd+I` (Mac) or `Ctrl+I` (Windows) to open Copilot chat
2. Paste the prompt above
3. Press Enter
4. Follow the suggestions

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### What happens next

Your AI assistant will:

1. **Install the Hyperstack CLI** — the command-line tool for Hyperstack
2. **Install agent skills** — teaching itself how to use Hyperstack correctly
3. **Discover available data** — finding out what blockchain data you can access
4. **Be ready to build** — waiting for your next instruction

This takes about 1-2 minutes. You'll see the AI explaining what it's doing as it goes.

---

## Step 4: Build Your First App

Once setup is complete, try this prompt:

<CopyPrompt>
Create a simple React app that shows live ORE mining data from Solana. Display the current round number and motherlode amount. Use Tailwind CSS for styling with a dark theme.
</CopyPrompt>

Your AI will:

- Create all the necessary files
- Set up a React project
- Connect to live Solana blockchain data
- Style it nicely

When it's done, it will tell you how to run the app (usually `npm run dev`).

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found" errors

If you see errors about commands not being found, you may need to install Node.js first:

1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Download the LTS version
3. Install it
4. Restart your AI coding tool
5. Try again

### The AI seems confused

If your AI doesn't understand Hyperstack, make sure it completed the setup step (Step 3). You can re-run the setup prompt to ensure skills are installed.
