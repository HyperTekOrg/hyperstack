//! Connection registry: tracks open WebSocket connections to Arete stacks.
//!
//! Each `connect` MCP call creates a new [`ConnectionEntry`]; each `disconnect`
//! removes one. The registry is a `DashMap` so per-entry locking does not
//! contend across tools running concurrently.
//!
//! Each connection owns one [`SharedStore`] (from `arete-sdk`) into which
//! the ingest task applies every inbound `Frame`. The store is keyed by view
//! internally, so a single connection can hold many subscribed views without
//! needing a second WebSocket. Subscription bookkeeping (which `subscription_id`
//! maps to which `(view, key)` on which connection) lives in
//! [`crate::subscriptions`].
//!
//! ## Subscribe/disconnect race safety
//!
//! Each entry carries a `tokio::sync::RwLock<bool>` (`alive`). The `subscribe`
//! tool acquires a read guard on it for the entire insert-sub + dispatch
//! window, after checking that the flag is still `true`. The `disconnect`
//! tool (a) removes the entry from the DashMap so no new `get()` can find it,
//! then (b) acquires the write lock — waiting for any in-flight subscribe
//! read-guards to drop — then (c) flips the flag and only then sweeps stale
//! subscription entries. The effect is that a concurrent subscribe either
//! finishes fully (and its subscription entry is later swept) or sees
//! `!alive` and returns without inserting anything. No orphans possible.
